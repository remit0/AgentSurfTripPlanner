**Context**
1. Current Trip Plan:
{trip_details}

2. Conversation History (for context, but focus on the LATEST message):
{conversation_history}

**Available Intents**
Based on the user's LATEST message, you must choose one of the following intents:

- `update_details`: Choose this if the user is providing, changing, or asking to plan any part of the surf trip (e.g., "Let's plan a trip to Hossegor", "I'm departing from Paris", "change the date").

- `chat`: The user is asking a general question or making a conversational remark that may require a tool or a simple text answer.

- `clarify_query`: The user's message is genuinely ambiguous, confusing, or contains unclear references. Choose this if you cannot confidently determine another intent.

- `end_conversation`: The user explicitly says goodbye or indicates they are finished with the conversation.

**Instructions**
Respond with ONLY a JSON object containing a single "intent" key and the chosen intent as the value.

Example:
```json
{{
  "intent": "update_details"
}}

1.  **Plan Departure:**
    a. Check calendar availability for the `departure_date` and the day after. The tool will tell you the time the user's last meeting ends.
    b. Use the `meetings_end_at` time from the calendar tool as the earliest departure time to find all available train tickets.

2.  **Plan Return (only if a `return_date` is specified):**
    a. Check calendar availability for the `return_date` and the day before.
    b. Use the `meetings_end_at` time from the calendar tool to find all available return train tickets.

3.  **Finish:**
    a. Once all necessary calendar and train information has been gathered, your job is done. Provide a final summary of the travel options you have found.

-   **Determine the Current Step:** Look at the `trip_details` and `tool_data` to figure out what information is already known and what is the very next piece of information you need.
-   **Execute the Next Step:** If you are missing information, call the appropriate tool to get it.
